## Current goal
Drive the local-first AI-OS (Python `aios/` backend + React `frontend/`) from its
current state to a polished, demoable MVP per the v4 blueprint — memory-driven,
security-gated, human-supervised, self-correcting.

## Status  (read from the CODE, not the blueprint's "~35%")
- **Reality: the backend is ~75–80% of the blueprint MVP, well past the doc's estimate.**
- Stack: Python 3.12 `.venv`, FastAPI + uvicorn, SQLite (WAL) + FAISS, Ollama (local LLM). Node backend archived on branch `legacy-node` / tag `legacy-node-v1`.
- Tests: **171 passed, 1 skipped** (`.venv/Scripts/python -m pytest -q`). The 1 skip = Windows symlink-privilege case (environmental, not a failure).
- Last completed + verified step: **Phase 4h DONE + premium polish pass DONE.** 4h live-verified (llama3.2:3b): pinned approval bar (YELLOW badge, clean prompt, always-visible Run/Reject). Then a 3-part chat polish on the WORKING components (eslint+build clean each step): #1 message entrance + agent-step cascade + bubble depth (`4f87dbc`); #2 global tactile button press + smooth transitions; #3 chat top scroll-fade (`7099a8a`). All motion gated by prefers-reduced-motion. Live run (llama3.2:3b) showed the card; fixed in sequence: (1) prompt leaked the classifier's raw regex → plain language; (2) step-spinner span forever on pause → `settled` flag; (3) **the Run/Reject buttons were clipped inside the scroll log → re-architected the approval as a PINNED action bar (flex-shrink-0) above the composer, premium-styled (glassmorphism + slide-up + glow), so controls are always visible.** 94 backend tests green; eslint+build clean. Lesson: never put a blocking decision inside a scroll container.

### BUILT & committed (per-phase commits on `master`)
- **Memory L2/L3/L4** — episodic, semantic (FAISS `IndexIDMap`), mistake pool; hybrid BM25+FAISS+decay retrieval `R = 0.25·BM25 + 0.45·FAISS + 0.30·e^(−0.05·Δt)`. `[aios/memory/]`
- **Security gateway** — deterministic fail-closed 3-zone (regex + scope-lock canonicalization + Shannon-entropy secret scan). `[aios/security/]`
- **Audit log** — SHA-256 hash chain, secret-scrubbed payloads, O(n) verify endpoint. `[aios/security/audit_logger.py]`
- **Reflection agent** — LLM post-mortem → Mistake pool (strict JSON, delta clamp, recurrence, pending→verified). `[aios/agents/reflection_agent.py]`
- **Planner** (0.72 confidence gate) · **Executor** (gateway-guarded, sandboxed, audited) · **Rollback** (GitPython snapshots). `[aios/core/, aios/agents/]`
- **FastAPI** — `/health`, `/api/v1/{memory/search, security/classify, audit/verify, reflect, plan, execute, approval/req, rollback, models/local}`, `/api/generate` (SSE), `/api/terminal`. `[aios/api/main.py]`
- **React frontend wired to FastAPI** (`:8000`, CORS), model picker lists installed Ollama models, Local/Cloud badge. `[frontend/]`
- **Agentic chat that acts + learns** — `/api/generate` runs a security-gated tool loop (read_file / read_directory / execute_terminal), recalls memory, persists + consolidates each turn into L2/L3, reflects on failures (🧠 lesson), promotes lessons pending→verified on a corrective success, and recalls a session's pending lessons across turns. `[aios/agents/tool_agent.py]`
- **Resumable in-chat approval (Phase 4h)** — a YELLOW command pauses the turn with a `human_required` event; the UI shows the approval card, and on approve the frontend re-sends the turn with the command in `approvedCommands`, so it runs via `executor.execute_approved` (RED still refused). Pausing records no answer, so the resend cleanly replays the same turn. `[aios/agents/tool_agent.py · aios/api/main.py · frontend/src/App.jsx]`

## Next action  → do this first on resume
**▶ LATEST 2026-06-07: PRE-T2 RUNWAY (a) — FINGERPRINT-RECONCILE FOR `self_analysis_report` — DONE &
GREEN (branch `claude/sharp-heisenberg-q2C1L`, draft PR → operator review → merge → `git pull`).**
Implemented `.aios/state/ULTRACODE_TASK.md` directly in Claude Code (operator asked me to build it, not
ultracode this time). THE NIT IT KILLS: PR#4's `write_report` did a plain INSERT per finding at
`status='open'`, so every `self_analyze` re-run piled up DUPLICATE open rows — T2 would then propose the
same fix N times. FIX: each `Finding` now carries a line-number-free `symbol` (func name / trimmed TODO
text / "" for one-per-module), and `finding_fingerprint = sha256(target_path\x1f finding_type\x1f symbol)`
gives a STABLE identity across runs (evidence/line numbers refresh; fingerprint doesn't).
`write_report` is now a SCOPE-CONFINED RECONCILE (→ `ReconcileResult{inserted,updated,closed,skipped,
open_total}`): decided rows (proposed/approved/applied/rejected/rolled_back) are SKIPPED (never
re-opened/duped); a matching open row is UPDATED (evidence refreshed); a new finding is INSERTED;
a vanished open finding is CLOSED (deleted — open rows are undecided + regenerable; decided rows are
NEVER deleted = the audit/decision lineage). Schema: `fingerprint TEXT` column added after `evidence`;
`db.py` gained an idempotent `_migrate` (ALTER ADD COLUMN on legacy DBs + DROP legacy open NULL-fp rows
+ a UNIQUE partial index `idx_sar_open_fp ON (fingerprint) WHERE status='open'` — created in `_migrate`,
not schema.sql, so it runs only after the column exists on fresh+migrated DBs). `_self_analyze` summary
now reports `{open_total} open ({inserted} new, {closed} resolved)` (kept the `Self-analysis of '{path}'`
+ `finding(s)` substrings a test pins). `analyze()` stays PURE/read-only; `aios/security/` untouched;
NO frontend change (per spec). **Verified:** full suite `172 passed, 4 skipped, 2 failed` — the 2 are
the SAME pre-existing/environmental `test_security.py` cases (confirmed identical with my changes
stashed). +6 reconcile tests (idempotent re-run · don't-reopen-decided · close-vanished · fingerprint-
stable-when-TODO-moves · scope-confined · legacy-DB migration) + the persistence test updated. **Real-
path smoke:** ran `self_analyze` over the live `aios/` TWICE → run1 inserted 45 / run2 inserted 0,
updated 45, 45 unique fingerprints = 45 rows (NO dup accumulation). **NEXT:** operator reviews/merges
this draft PR; then runway **(b)** static tooling (radon cyclomatic + coverage.py join; heavy/new-deps →
ultracode job, spec issued after this merges so it reflects the reconcile shape), **(c)** golden-
regression harness, **(d)** doc the frozen core in CLAUDE.md (§VIII: I PROPOSE the diff, operator
approves) → **T2** (propose-diff, YELLOW + no-self-approval guard + two-snapshot check, §6.3) → T3 → T4.
Also still queued: the `create_file` tool spec (`.aios/state/ULTRACODE_NEXT_create_file.md`) — both it
and (b) touch `tool_agent.py`, so rebase to keep diffs clean.

**▶ PRIOR 2026-06-07 (resumed). Operator gave the GO for the whole pre-T2 runway in my recommended
order: (a) report-row hygiene → (b) coverage/radon → (c) golden tests → (d) doc frozen core → T2 → T3
→ T4.** WORKING MODEL set this session: **ultracode (Claude-web) BUILDS the heavy items; Claude Code
(local) REVIEWS its PR on evidence + MERGES** — the proven #1–#4 loop. HONESTY (CLAUDE.md §0/§X): I
cannot launch ultracode or `/code-review ultra` myself (operator's browser/billed action); my half is
the airtight spec + the evidence review + the merge. (NOTE: for (a) the operator routed the build to me
directly — done above.)
**TWO PARALLEL TRACKS (decided this session):**
- **BUILD track (ultracode builds → I review+merge):** **(a) fingerprint-reconcile** spec at
  `.aios/state/ULTRACODE_TASK.md` is pushed (origin `6615717`) — operator launches ultracode on it →
  PR → I `gh pr checkout`, run the Windows baseline (171/1 + new), re-prove read-only + frozen core,
  squash-merge + reset onto origin/master. **Queued next: `create_file` tool** spec at
  `.aios/state/ULTRACODE_NEXT_create_file.md` — START AFTER (a) MERGES (both touch `tool_agent.py`;
  rebase to keep the diff clean). Then (b) coverage/radon → (c) golden tests → (d) doc (a §VIII change:
  I PROPOSE the CLAUDE.md diff, operator approves) → T2→T4.
- **BREATHE track (the AI-OS dogfoods itself in its sandbox, on Ollama):** seed pair staged
  (untracked) — `training_ground/greeter.py` (planted bug: `greet()` drops the name) +
  `training_ground/test_greeter.py` (fails until fixed). Operator runs backend+frontend, picks
  `qwen2.5-coder:7b`, and drives the full loop: read → (run pytest, fail) → reflect 🧠 → propose
  `edit_file` diff → APPROVE (YELLOW) → snapshot+write → verify (pass) → lesson promoted. This is the
  first real breath; it stays OFF the build track's critical path. KEY FACT: the agent can ONLY write
  inside `training_ground/` (SCOPE_ROOTS); editing its own `aios/` source is auto-RED — that is T2+,
  the guarded evolution step, NOT a shortcut.

`git status` noise (`training_ground/data.json` + the PDF + 4 parked CSS + the 2 new seed files) is
expected, not drift. HONESTY (§0): I cannot launch ultracode or the Ollama run — those are the
operator's physical actions; I spec, stage, watch pasted output, and review+merge.

**▶ CURRENT (2026-06-07): SELF-ANALYSIS MODULE — READ-ONLY FOUNDATION (T0 + T1) — DONE, REVIEWED
ON EVIDENCE, & MERGED to `master` (PR #4 → squash `4cb01b6`). Full suite 171 passed / 1 skipped
on Windows; brain pushed.**
The first, zero-risk slice of the AUDIT's marquee feature (Assessment §6). STRICTLY READ-ONLY:
never edits source, never executes, loads NO model — pure stdlib (`ast`/`pathlib`/`hashlib`/`re`).
T2 (propose-diff) / T3 (apply) / T4 (core edit) are LATER increments — deliberately NOT built.
**(1) `aios/agents/self_analysis_agent.py` — `SelfAnalysisAgent`.** Default scope = the `aios/`
package under `config.PROJECT_ROOT`; `scope_root`/`tests_root`/`path_root`/`db_path` all injectable
(tests point it at a fixture tree). **T0 (index):** per-module `ModuleFacts` via `ast` — rel path,
LOC, function names, class names, imports — + a simple intra-package import/dependency map.
**T1 (diagnose):** deterministic `Finding(target_path, finding_type, evidence)` — `missing_test`
(a testable module, i.e. defines a func/class & not `__init__`, with no `tests/test_<stem>.py`),
`smell` (>40 LOC defining nothing, or an over-long function), `todo` (TODO/FIXME/XXX/HACK + line),
`complexity` (AST branch-count proxy over a threshold). Deterministic facts ONLY — no LLM
commentary this increment (`llm_commentary`/`proposed_zone`/`proposed_diff` left NULL; trust
evidence, not the model). `analyze()` is pure/read-only; `write_report()`/`read_findings()`
persist/query (ensure schema via idempotent `init_memory_db`). TODOs left for the later
coverage.py join + radon metric + dead_code.
**(2) `self_analysis_report` table** added to `aios/memory/schema.sql` via the existing idempotent
`IF NOT EXISTS` pattern (same MEMORY_DB), schema per §6.4 (id, timestamp, target_path,
finding_type, evidence, llm_commentary, proposed_zone, proposed_diff, status DEFAULT 'open' w/
CHECK, applied_audit_id) + the two indexes (status, target_path).
**(3) Wired READ-ONLY as a `self_analyze` tool** in `tool_agent.py` (mirrors verify/plan): TOOL_SPECS
entry (optional `path`, default `aios`); `_dispatch` → `_self_analyze`, which confines `path` with
the SAME `_resolve_within(self.read_root, …)` resolver as `read_file` (refuses `../`/abs/symlink
escape), runs the agent, writes the report, returns a summary (counts by finding_type + top 8).
status `ok`, `failed=False` — read-only, never reflected. Frontend: one additive `MessageBubble.jsx`
TOOL_META entry (🔬 "Self-analysis").
**Verified:** new `tests/test_self_analysis.py` (7) all pass — T0 map (funcs/classes/LOC/imports +
intra-edge), T1 todo(+line)/smell/missing_test, over-long-function smell, write→read rows (open,
T2 cols NULL), **source-hash-unchanged before/after (never writes source)**, tool returns a
summary, path-escape refused. Full suite `166 passed, 4 skipped, 2 failed` — the 2 fails are the
SAME PRE-EXISTING + ENVIRONMENTAL `test_security.py` cases (Windows `C:\…` path GREEN on Linux +
`/tmp/pytest-…` entropy false-positive), confirmed IDENTICAL with my changes stashed. Frontend
**eslint clean + vitest 9/9 + vite build** all green. **Real-path smoke:** ran the analyzer over
the live `aios/` (31 modules, 41 findings {missing_test 20, complexity 11, smell 5, todo 5}, 65
intra-package import edges, clean DB round-trip). Frozen security core untouched.
**REVIEW (2026-06-07, Windows, evidence):** checked out PR #4 → full suite **171 passed / 1
skipped** (164 baseline + 7); frontend **eslint + vitest 9/9 + build** green; **independently
reproduced** the real-tree smoke (31 modules, 41 findings {missing_test 20, complexity 11, smell 5,
todo 5}, 65 import edges) AND re-proved READ-ONLY by SHA-256-hashing the live `aios/` tree
before/after a full `analyze()`+`write_report()` (`REAL_SOURCE_UNCHANGED: True`); confirmed
`_resolve_within` is the SAME fail-closed resolver `read_file` uses (escape → `tool_blocked`),
`get_connection` commits, frozen `aios/security/` untouched. Correct as-submitted — no patch needed
(like PR #3). The one brain-file (RESUME.md) conflict was resolved by merging `origin/master` INTO
the branch (took ours), pushing, then squash-merging (`gh pr merge 4 --squash --delete-branch`).
**NEXT ACTION (decide as CEO + Architect — propose ONE, then wait for the go):** the runway before
T2 — **(a) report-row hygiene** (the only nit that bites T2: live `self_analyze` always INSERTs
every finding as `open`, so re-runs accumulate duplicate rows → add a scan/run grouping or de-dup
BEFORE T2 turns findings into proposals); **(b) static tooling** (coverage.py + radon — turn the
TODO proxies into real metrics + refine the coarse `missing_test` heuristic); **(c) golden-regression
harness**; **(d) document the frozen core in CLAUDE.md**. THEN **T2 (propose-diff, YELLOW + diff
preview)** → **T3 (apply: snapshot → verify → audit → auto-rollback)** → **T4 (core edit, RED,
frozen)**. T2+ also needs the no-self-approval guard in the approval endpoint + the two-snapshot
integrity check (§6.3).

**(prior 2026-06-07): TIER-2 HARDENING — ROLLBACK GIT-DB OUT-OF-TREE (#3) + TEST DATA_DIR
ISOLATION (#4) — DONE & GREEN — MERGED (PR #3).** Cleared the two AUDIT.md Tier-2 structural-debt
items in ONE focused PR, kept as two separable changes each with its own tests.
**FIX #3 (rollback repo inside the tracked tree):** the engine snapshotted a git repo INSIDE
`config.SCOPE_ROOTS[0]` (`training_ground`), which the MAIN repo tracks → embedded-repo wrinkle
+ `training_ground/.gitkeep` showed untracked. Added `config.ROLLBACK_DIR` (default
`DATA_DIR/"rollback"`, gitignored; `AIOS_ROLLBACK_DIR` overridable). `RollbackEngine` now keeps
the sandbox as the git WORK-TREE but puts its git DATABASE under `ROLLBACK_DIR` via
`Repo.init(work_tree, separate_git_dir=...)`, leaving only a tiny `gitdir:` POINTER file in
`training_ground/`. Re-opening via the work-tree transparently follows that pointer (history
preserved). An injected `repo_dir` (tests, already a tmp dir) keeps its DB in-tree — original
behavior intact; project-root refusal guard untouched. Also gitignored `training_ground/.git`
+ `training_ground/.gitkeep` (local scratch, like `data/`). **Verified in the real production
path:** `training_ground/.git` is a 43-byte pointer, the real DB (HEAD/objects) is under
`data/rollback/`, and `git status` shows NO `training_ground/.git*` or `.gitkeep` (all gitignored,
confirmed via `git check-ignore`). +3 tests in `tests/test_rollback.py` (DB out-of-tree + e2e
snapshot/rollback through external DB · reopen-via-pointer preserves history · injected repo_dir
stays in-tree).
**FIX #4 (tests shared the live DATA_DIR):** added `tests/conftest.py` that sets
`os.environ["AIOS_DATA_DIR"]` to a fresh `tempfile.mkdtemp` at MODULE level — before `aios.config`
is first imported — so config derives DATA_DIR / MEMORY_DB_PATH / AUDIT_DB_PATH / FAISS_INDEX_PATH
/ ROLLBACK_DIR under the temp dir for the whole session; the real `data/` is never read/written
(atexit cleanup). An isolated temp index is empty, so `hybrid_search` short-circuits to `[]`
WITHOUT loading the embedder — so I REMOVED the now-unnecessary `client`-fixture `hybrid_search`
stub in `tests/test_api.py` (no model/network/shell side-effect added to any test path; the
contract is pinned by a test). +3 tests in new `tests/test_data_isolation.py` (DATA_DIR is the
temp dir, not project `data/` · all derived paths live under it · `hybrid_search` returns `[]`
on the empty index with `EmbeddingModel.instance` made to explode if loaded).
**Verified this env:** full suite `159 passed, 4 skipped, 2 failed` — the 2 fails are the SAME
PRE-EXISTING + ENVIRONMENTAL `test_security.py` cases (Windows `C:\…` path classified GREEN on
Linux + a random `/tmp/pytest-…` dir tripping the entropy scanner); confirmed they fail
IDENTICALLY with my changes stashed (they are not mine). Frozen security core + frontend
untouched. **NEXT:** operator reviews/merges the draft PR, then (5) **Self-Analysis module** —
now fully unblocked: plan-before-act + verify-after + a clean rollback engine all live, so
apply→verify→auto-rollback has every piece; its tests can rely on real DATA_DIR isolation.

**(prior 2026-06-07): PLANNER + CONFIDENCE GATE WIRED INTO THE LIVE LOOP — DONE & GREEN
(branch `claude/sharp-heisenberg-q2C1L`, draft PR #2 → operator review → merge → `git pull`).**
AUDIT Tier-1 #2, mirroring the merged `verify` pattern (PR #1). Added a `plan` tool to
`aios/agents/tool_agent.py`: new TOOL_SPECS entry (one `goal` param) routed in `_dispatch`
to `_plan`, backed by `Planner(planner_llm)` built ONCE in `__init__` (reuses `planner.py`,
not rewritten). **CRITICAL client split honored:** the Planner needs a COMPLETION client
(`.complete()`), NOT the loop's chat client `self.llm` (may be cloud Bedrock, no
`.complete()`) — so `ToolAgent.__init__` takes an injected `planner_llm: Optional[LLMClient]`,
and `main.py /api/generate` passes it via `Depends(get_llm_client)` (the local completion
model, same dep `/api/v1/plan` + reflection use). `_plan` is ADVISORY + fail-soft: no planner
→ `[plan unavailable]`; `PlannerError` → `[plan error] …`; success → ordered steps w/
confidences + an explicit "N step(s) need human review (confidence < 0.72): …" section when
`requires_human`. ALWAYS status `ok`, `failed=False` — planning is never a security block and
never reflected on; real actions still pass the gate + approval. Did NOT auto-plan per turn,
did NOT pause-on-`requires_human` (out of scope). Frontend: one additive `plan` TOOL_META
entry (📋 "Plan"). +4 tests in `tests/test_tool_agent.py` (lists steps · flags <0.72 step ·
PlannerError surfaced cleanly, no reflect · graceful unavailable + loop still `done`).
**Verified this env:** backend `152 passed, 4 skipped, 2 failed` — the 2 fails are the SAME
PRE-EXISTING + ENVIRONMENTAL `test_security.py` cases (Windows `C:\…` path + a random
`/tmp/pytest-…` dir tripping the entropy scanner; identical with my changes stashed; Windows
baseline 153/1). Frontend **vitest 9/9 + build + eslint all green** (deps installed this run).
**NEXT:** operator reviews/merges PR #2, then (3) rollback nested-`.git` + DATA_DIR isolation,
(4) static tooling + golden tests + pull `qwen2.5-coder:7b`, (5) **Self-Analysis module** (now
fully unblocked: plan-before-act + verify-after both live → apply→verify→auto-rollback has its
pieces).

**(prior 2026-06-07): VERIFIER WIRED INTO THE LIVE LOOP — DONE & GREEN (branch
`claude/sharp-heisenberg-q2C1L`, draft PR → operator review → merge → `git pull`).**
Closed the AUDIT.md KEY GAP (Verifier built but "wired to nothing"). Added a `verify`
tool to `aios/agents/tool_agent.py`: a new TOOL_SPECS entry (one `command` param) routed
in `_dispatch` to a `Verifier(self.executor, on_failure=self.on_failure)` built ONCE in
`__init__` (reuses `verifier.py`, not rewritten). `_verify` calls
`.verify(command, session_id=...)` and maps `VerifierResult` → the loop's
`(output, status, failed)` shape: a security BLOCK → `tool_blocked` (RED/out-of-scope
verify refused by the gateway, never run — not bypassed); a pass/fail → `tool_result`
with a `[VERIFY PASS|FAIL] N passed, M failed (exit C)` line + summary the model/UI see.
Fail-closed kept. **No double-reflect:** the Verifier fires `on_failure` itself; `run()`
only reflects for `execute_terminal`, so the dispatch path adds none. Frontend: one
additive `verify` entry in `MessageBubble.jsx` `TOOL_META` (✅ "Verify"). +3 tests in
`tests/test_tool_agent.py` (pass→no reflect · fail→reflects once · RED→blocked, runner
never called). **Suite on Linux: 148 passed, 2 failed, 4 skipped — the 2 fails are
PRE-EXISTING + ENVIRONMENTAL** (test_security.py: a `C:\Windows\...` path + a random
`/tmp/pytest-…` dir name tripping the entropy scanner; both fail identically with my
changes stashed — Windows baseline was 150/1). All tool_agent + verifier tests pass.
**NEXT:** operator reviews/merges the draft PR, then **(2) wire Planner+confidence** into
the live loop (next build step), then (3) rollback nested-`.git` + DATA_DIR isolation,
(4) static tooling + golden tests, (5) Self-Analysis module (now unblocked: apply→verify
→auto-rollback has its verify).
NOTE (this env): no `.venv` checked in; tests run via a throwaway venv with the ML
training stack (torch/transformers/sentence-transformers) omitted — they're lazy-loaded
and the suite stubs the embedder, so faiss+numpy suffice. Windows run cmd unchanged.

**(prior 2026-06-06): edit_file path bug FIXED + committed `68653dc` (master).** The live e2e
"file is empty" error was a path-doubling bug — `edit_file` resolved sandbox-relative while reads
resolve project-relative, so `training_ground/data.json` → `training_ground/training_ground/data.json`
(nonexistent). Fixed `_edit_file` to resolve under `read_root` before the scope check (frozen
`scope_lock` core untouched) + a regression test + aligned test fixtures. **Suite: 150 passed, 1
skipped.** Now standing up a **private GitHub remote** so the operator can use Claude-web "ultracode"
(local box is RAM-bound). `gh` v2.93 installed + authed (**swap821**). **DONE — private remote LIVE:** `origin` =
https://github.com/swap821/ai-editor · `master` pushed (fix `68653dc` on origin/master) · no secrets
tracked. **NEXT (operator, browser): (1)** connect the repo to Claude-web (authorize the Claude GitHub
app) to enable ultracode/PRs; **(2)** add the ABSK key + region as cloud secrets
(`AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK`, `AIOS_BEDROCK_REGION`), never committed; **(3)** run the live e2e of the
fix (Bedrock): change hello→hi in `training_ground/data.json` → approval bar shows the diff → Apply →
file updated + pre-edit snapshot.
**✅ E2E VERIFIED (2026-06-07, live Bedrock):** diff shown → Apply → `training_ground/data.json` =
`{ "greeting": "hi" }`; pre-edit snapshot `dce2427` in the nested `training_ground/.git`. The full
chain (model → edit_file → diff → human approval → snapshot → write) is proven in the real app — the
edit_file path bug is fully closed. Steps 1–2 (connect repo to Claude-web + cloud secrets) remain
optional for *cloud* runs. **NEXT (2026-06-07): operator pivoted to BACKEND.** Full backend check-up done →
`.aios/state/AUDIT.md` (core ≈90% test-backed, 150/1; KEY GAP = Planner/Verifier/Confidence built but
NOT wired into the live `/api/generate` loop). Build order: **(1) wire the Verifier into the live loop
via ultracode** (prompt drafted; PR → I review locally → merge → `git pull`); (2) wire
Planner+confidence; (3) fix rollback nested-`.git` + test/DATA_DIR isolation; (4) static tooling +
golden tests + pull `qwen2.5-coder:7b` (16 GB RAM now); (5) **Self-Analysis module** (marquee feature,
v6 assessment §6). UI deferred. Brain syncs to origin (swap821/ai-editor) via the cloud workflow.

--- (prior next-action history below) ---
**PHASE 1+2 DONE; SLICE 1 (1a+1b) DONE & GREEN (2026-06-03).** Full suite **124 passed,
1 skipped**. `PLAN.md` targets **100% / no left-outs** (fundamentals-first; deferrals are
later phases, not dropped).
- **Slice 1a — security-scope hardening (FROZEN CORE): DONE & committed (`e7bba3c`).**
  Fixed 3 live scope bypasses an xhigh review found in the prior `command_stays_in_scope`
  rewrite (`~/…` home, shell-metachar-glued abs paths, bare `..` — all had classified
  GREEN). `_SHELL_OPS` pre-split + `~` refusal + `..` guard; 5 regression tests; legit
  `.venv\Scripts\python.exe`/`&&` cases still YELLOW.
- **Slice 1b — API contract tests: DONE & GREEN (uncommitted).** 8 HTTP tests in
  `tests/test_api.py` for `/plan,/execute,/approval/req,/rollback`; the 4 route handlers
  are now fully covered. The `/approval/req` test pins the D1 hard-block at the HTTP layer.
- **D1 (RED policy): DECIDED — keep hard-block** (RED always refused even after approval;
  stricter than the blueprint, by choice). Recorded in `PLAN.md` + memory.
- Operator memories saved (independent dev; 100% goal; CEO role) + `CEO_LOG.md` (Advice #1).
  Commits: `e39a3f8` v6 · `e7bba3c` scope fix · `2b657dd` blueprint cleanup · `ba5d838` planning.
- **Slice 2 — file-edit tool (patch-style `edit_file`), backend: DONE & GREEN.** Per
  operator, built as search/replace (unique old_string → unified-diff preview → YELLOW
  pause → pre-write snapshot + write + audit on approval), scope-locked to sandbox roots.
  5 tests in `test_tool_agent.py`. Live path stays SAFE: `edit_file` always pauses until
  Slice 4 wires `approvedEdits` + the snapshot/diff UI. Full suite **129 passed, 1 skipped**.
- **Slice 3 — frontend test harness: DONE & GREEN.** Installed vitest + RTL + jsdom
  (operator-approved). Extracted the SSE frame parser to `src/lib/sse.js` (wired into
  `App.jsx` streamGenerate, behavior-preserving) + vitest config/setup + `npm test` script.
  Tests: `sse.test.js` (4) + `MessageBubble.test.jsx` (3) = **7 passing**; `npm run build` clean.
- **Slice 5 — Verifier stage (Blueprint stage 8): DONE & GREEN.** New `aios/core/verifier.py`
  runs a test command through the gated Executor, judges pass/fail by exit code + parsed
  pytest/jest counts, returns a bounded confidence delta, and feeds failures to a reflection
  hook (fail-closed on blocked/timeout). 5 tests. Full suite **134 passed, 1 skipped**.
- **Slice 7 — L3 entity facts + contradiction detection (Blueprint 5.3): DONE & GREEN.**
  New `semantic_facts` table + `aios/memory/facts.py` (`SemanticFacts`): `(subject,predicate,object)`
  triples; `add_fact` detects a same-subject+predicate / different-object **contradiction** and
  refuses to silently commit it (returns the conflict to route to reflection/human); `reconcile`
  supersedes + commits the chosen object; exact duplicates idempotent. 4 tests. Full suite **138 passed, 1 skipped**.
  Frontend-polish-worker idea now recorded **permanently in memory** (`frontend-polish-worker-idea`) + PLAN.md.
- **Slice 4 — diff-preview approval (CODE HALF): DONE & GREEN.** 4a (backend, committed `e5bfbc7`):
  `approvedEdits` + a lazy pre-write snapshot wired through `/api/generate`; the edit `human_required`
  SSE carries the diff + edit triple. 4b (frontend): a `DiffView` component renders the unified diff
  in the (unchanged, working) approval bar; `approvedEdits` state + resume wired
  (`handleApproveAction`/`handleRejectAction`/`streamGenerate`). Frontend **9 tests** (DiffView ×2);
  `npm run build` clean; backend 140.
- **Slice 4c — hardening pass (DONE & GREEN):** fixed all 8 findings from the max-effort self
  /code-review of this session's code. `edit_file` is now **fail-closed on snapshot AND audit** (a
  failure of either blocks the edit), **audits before writing**, and applies the *approved* edit by
  **filepath** (robust to a local model regenerating drifted args on resume); verifier **trusts the
  exit code** + **skips reflection on security blocks**; `facts.reconcile` rejects empty; App.jsx
  approve message fixed. +6 tests. Full suite **146 passed, 1 skipped**; frontend 9; build clean.
- **Slice 6 — prompt-injection vector blocklist (FROZEN CORE, operator-approved): DONE & GREEN.**
  `aios/security/injection_shield.py` (`VectorInjectionShield`) embeds a curated injection set and
  flags inputs with cosine ≥ threshold; `gateway.classify` consults an installed shield after the
  regex layer. Deterministic · fail-safe (embedder error → regex-only) · opt-in (`AIOS_INJECTION_VECTOR_SHIELD`,
  default off; API installs it at startup when set). 3 tests; all prior security tests pass regex-only.
  Full suite **149 passed, 1 skipped**.
- **Bedrock re-enabled + LIVE on cloud (2026-06-04): WORKING.** Operator ran the agent on AWS Bedrock
  (RAM-free): `query_knowledge` + `read_directory` + `read_file` all executed via the gated tools, the
  cloud model reliably emitted tool calls, and it **correctly declined to edit an EMPTY `data.json`**
  (`edit_file` is search/replace — nothing to match; the safe behavior we built). So the **cloud pipeline
  + agentic loop + tool-calling + reasoning are CONFIRMED working.** Verified this boto3 (botocore 1.43.20)
  supports the `ABSK` bearer token via dynamic `AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK`+`httpBearerAuth`; fixed the
  dropdown's fictional model ids → real Nova/Claude/Llama/Mistral ids; documented env in `.env.example`.
**Next action — OPERATOR (finish the e2e, one step left):** seed a file with content
(`Set-Content training_ground\data.json '{ "greeting": "hello" }'`), then ask the agent to change
"hello"→"hi" via `edit_file` → confirm the **approval bar shows the diff** → Apply → file written +
`[SNAPSHOT] pre-edit` in `git -C training_ground log`. That's the only unexercised piece. Then **Slice 8**
(polish/freeze). NOTE: no "create file" tool yet (`edit_file` is patch-only) — acceptable for MVP; could
add a `create_file` tool later. Later phases: voice, KG, Docker, chaos/perf, frontend-polish worker.
**Parked:** 4 untracked premium CSS files (intentional, for a later polish phase).

--- (prior Phase-4h candidates, retained for context) ---
**Phase 4h is DONE and committed.** Pick the next build step. Candidates, in rough
priority (propose one, then STOP for the operator's go before writing code):
1. **Live e2e demo pass (RAM-gated).** Load `llama3.2:3b`, run backend + frontend,
   and walk the full happy path: chat → YELLOW command → approval card → resume →
   command runs → reflection. This is the highest-value next step (proves 4h end-to-end)
   but needs ~4 GB free RAM (close other apps). Set `AIOS_INDEX_CHAT=false` /
   `AIOS_REFLECT_ON_FAILURE=false` on a tight run to avoid extra model loads.
2. ~~Reject-on-resume polish~~ **DONE** — `handleRejectAction` now clears the
   approval whitelist + pending action and posts "Rejected — the command was not run."
3. **Offline voice (Whisper + Piper)** — fully local STT/TTS; bigger scope.
4. **Docker + Prometheus/Grafana** — packaging/observability; bigger scope.

The next *substantive* step is the live e2e demo (RAM-gated, operator-driven) — see
the runbook; free ~3 GB first (only 1.31 GB free at last checkpoint).

Note: approval whitelist is **per-request** (frontend resets `approvedCommands` on each
new user message; grows it only across an approve→resume chain). That's the intended
security boundary — re-check it if you change the resume flow.

Deferred (unchanged): offline voice; Docker + Prometheus/Grafana.

### Frontend stabilization (after a parallel rewrite broke it)
A concurrent "premium 2026" rewrite landed uncommitted in the tree (rewritten
`MessageBubble.jsx`/`LivePreview.jsx` with **incompatible props** — `{message,isUser}`
vs the `{msg}` the app passes — plus new `styles/{App,design-system,nexgen-3d,nexgen-layout}.css`
imported into App.jsx/index.css). It broke the chat render. Per operator choice we
**stabilized**: restored the working components + clean `index.css` baseline, stripped
the foreign imports, and **parked the 4 new CSS files untracked+unimported** (preserved,
not deleted) for the upcoming incremental polish. App builds clean; pinned approval bar kept.
**Next (polish phase):** layer premium polish onto the WORKING components one increment at a
time (verify build each step); optionally mine the parked CSS for ideas. Don't re-import it wholesale.

### Cloud inference (AWS Bedrock) — NEW, opt-in
Local Ollama CUDA-OOMs on the 4GB RTX 3050, so a **Bedrock cloud provider** was
added (`aios/core/bedrock.py`, Converse API + tool-use; routed in `/api/generate`
via `_select_chat_client`). Local-first stays the default; Bedrock is **off**
unless a region is set. Auth uses the operator's new **Bedrock API key** (`ABSK…`,
a bearer token — NOT an IAM `AKIA…` key) via `AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK`. The model
defaults to `amazon.nova-lite-v1:0`, so only **region + key** are needed:
```
$env:AIOS_BEDROCK_REGION      = "us-east-1"   # the operator's region
$env:AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK = "ABSK..."     # the Bedrock API key (env only)
# optional: $env:AIOS_BEDROCK_MODEL = "<other model/inference-profile id>"
```
Then in the UI pick a **Cloud (Bedrock)** model → routes to Bedrock on THAT model
(the selected id is passed through to Converse). Secrets live only in env.

**Model picker DONE:** `BedrockClient.list_models()` (control-plane
ListFoundationModels, TEXT+ON_DEMAND) → `/api/v1/models/bedrock`; the frontend
shows a real "Cloud (Bedrock)" group (curated fallback if discovery is blocked).
107 tests pass. NOTE: the test suite now stubs `aios.api.main.hybrid_search` in
the `client` fixture — live app usage had populated the on-disk FAISS index, so
generate tests were loading the real embedder and **segfaulting torch**; the stub
isolates tests from live `data/` (no model side-effects in tests).

## Open approvals / blockers
- Live happy-path is gated by host RAM (7.5 GB). Close other apps so `llama3.2:3b` fits (~4 GB free). `AIOS_INDEX_CHAT` and `AIOS_REFLECT_ON_FAILURE` each add an extra model load — set them `false` on tight runs.

## Active files  (Runway (a) fingerprint-reconcile — on branch `claude/sharp-heisenberg-q2C1L`:)
- `aios/agents/self_analysis_agent.py` (`Finding`+`symbol`, module-level `finding_fingerprint`, new `ReconcileResult`, `write_report` rewritten as a scope-confined reconcile) · `aios/memory/schema.sql` (+`fingerprint` column after `evidence`) · `aios/memory/db.py` (+idempotent `_migrate`: ALTER ADD COLUMN + drop legacy open NULL-fp rows + UNIQUE partial index `idx_sar_open_fp`) · `aios/agents/tool_agent.py` (`_self_analyze` summary uses `ReconcileResult`) · `tests/test_self_analysis.py` (persistence test updated + 6 reconcile tests). NO frontend change.
- (all merged:) verify tool (PR #1) · planner/plan tool (PR #2) · Tier-2 rollback-DB + DATA_DIR isolation (PR #3) · Self-Analysis T0/T1 (PR #4).

## Notes not yet promoted to memory
- Run backend: `.venv\Scripts\python -m uvicorn aios.api.main:app --port 8000`. Run frontend: `cd frontend; npm run dev` (:5173). Tests: `.venv\Scripts\python -m pytest -q`.
- The repo uses per-phase commits on `master` (not `main`). Keep that cadence.
