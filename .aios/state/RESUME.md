# RESUME MANIFEST

Last updated: 2026-06-21T20:40:00+05:30

## Current Goal
Convert the living-being frontend blueprint into a 100% working live organism. **Phase 3 LANDED + Claude-reviewer-approved (commit 2eda588, against pinned snapshot 0ff2ea0).** Current lane: **ORCHESTRATION (poster panel 5) — the LOCKED MODEL + its SOUL**: the being CROWNS the top, shrinks with tab-count, the spine feeds the focus, waiting tabs hang nerve-tethered in the corners. Codex on leave until 2026-06-25; Claude is solo (builder + reviewer). Operator steering remotely; visual sign-off delegated to Claude via kimi-webbridge at :5173. Canon re-scoped 2026-06-19: lab unrestricted, only palette+textures sacred. **2026-06-21 SINGLE-FRONTEND COLLAPSE (operator):** the points-being GAGOS is now the ONE official frontend at the clean root `/` — `?ui=classic` / `?ui=shell` and all non-points surfaces DELETED; default flipped mesh→points (product + lab). New front: renovate this single frontend to world-class (north-star: `.aios/state/GAGOS_RENOVATION_NORTHSTAR.md`). Test on `:5173/` (no params).

## SESSION 2026-06-21 (evening) — POSTER-PALETTE MATCH "everything" (LANDED + committed)
- **Operator directive (remote):** "remember poster? i want same visual aesthetics and color palettes of everything" + "keep going i m going remote." Made the live frontend's color palette match the VARIANT-H poster's hero tetrad across EVERY rendering layer. Conservative (operator away): hue-only re-points, intensity/density left as his RTX FIDELITY dials.
- **Poster tetrad (the single source of accent truth):** cyan `#7bf5fb` · purple `#b06eff` · green `#54f0a0` · orange `#ff7e40`. The poster has ZERO blue.
- **3 commits (all product-safe + lab-mirrored, build + 209/209 green throughout, live-verified in a FRESH kimi tab to dodge the degraded-GPU-context artifact):**
  1. `56a2c5e` **chrome blue→cyan** — the global accent ramp was still blue→indigo (`#3b82f6`/`#60a5fa`/`#6366f1`), live on every `:focus-visible` ring + `--accent-grad`/`-dim`/`-glow` + `--info`. Re-pointed the whole ramp in `tokens.css` to poster cyan with a cyan→purple hero gradient; `index.css` `@theme --color-accent` → cyan. (`tokens.css`/`index.css` are product-side globals, NOT lab-ported.)
  2. `21df8c8` **being posture spectral → poster tetrad** — `bodyPosture.ts` BODY_POSTURES hues had drifted off the "STATUS FROM BODY" legend (stream was `#36d6ff` deep blue-cyan). Re-pointed: stream→`#7bf5fb`, think→`#b06eff`, rest→calm lavender `#9e78f5`, hold→`#ff7e40`, complete→`#54f0a0`, error unchanged (warm alarm). Per-posture INTENSITY (flow/tint/`POSTURE_DIAL`) UNTOUCHED = his RTX call. Tests re-pinned to the tetrad (18 + 209 green); lab-mirrored. Live: the materializing crown now blooms the brighter poster cyan (verified via `__materializeTab`).
  3. `4049874` **tab neon edge → poster cyan** — `MaterializedTab.tsx` points-mode slab frame was hardcoded `#36d6ff` → `#7bf5fb`. Per-role tab content palettes left as-is (already a poster-harmonious cyan/warm/green family). Lab-mirrored.
- **Sweep clean:** only remaining non-poster blue is `constants.ts:22 indigo:'#6366f1'` — verified DEAD (old organ/panel system deleted; zero active consumer). Left untouched (lab-sacred file, no visible gain).
- **NEXT (operator's RTX, FIDELITY-gated):** final brightness/density/saturation of the being via `__POINTFIELD`/`__POSTURE` dials; drive a real cloud-Gemini code turn (set `AIOS_ROUTER_CLOUD_TASKS`) to tour think-purple→stream-cyan→hold-orange→complete-green live + capture goldens; the HELD approval slab (`reverse_string.py`) still awaits his APPROVE/REJECT (never self-approved).

## SESSION 2026-06-21 (afternoon) — SINGLE-FRONTEND COLLAPSE + renovation kickoff (LANDED, uncommitted)
- **Operator decision (explicit, repeated):** the points-being GAGOS at the clean root `/` is THE one and only official frontend — "delete forcefully everything not related to this." SUPERSEDES the older "keep `?ui=classic` fallback" caveat (CEO 2026-06-16) and the Shell-as-official line.
- **Done:** `main.jsx` renders only `SuperbrainApp` (no `?ui` routing); `beingMode` default flipped mesh→points (product `frontend/src/superbrain/lib/beingMode.ts` + test AND lab-mirrored `GAG demo/gag-orchestrator/src/lib/beingMode.ts`); `index.html` → GAGOS (title/meta/noscript). DELETED 27 paths — classic `App.jsx/.css` + classic `components/*` (kept `ErrorBoundary`), `SuperbrainShell.jsx`, `workbench/{CommandLine,ForgePorts,BrainstemIntake,shell.css,forge.css,manufacturing.css,organs/*,approval/*}` (kept `GagosChrome.jsx/.css`), classic `src/lib/*`. Kept `styles/tokens.css` (global token chain).
- **Verified:** `vite build` 876ms (658 modules, no dangling imports) · `vitest run` 209/209 green · clean `/` boots the points-being live · backend `:8000` up · real turn proven (llama3.2:3b → "Namaste!", thinking→complete posture captured via kimi-webbridge).
- **Honest trade-off:** OrgansDock governance/learning views (autonomy ledger, curriculum, memory search, models, skills, etc.) + classic shell are GONE from the UI — that backend depth is now unsurfaced. Per the poster it should return as MATERIALIZED TABS from the being, not a 2D dock (deferred, operator's call).
- **Stale doc:** AGENTS.md §XI still references `?ui=classic` + lists `App.jsx` as product-safe — now removed; fix on operator go (§VIII rulebook).
- **NEXT:** renovate the single frontend to world-class per `.aios/state/GAGOS_RENOVATION_NORTHSTAR.md` — front-door → elevate, sacred poster palette untouched, operator `:5173` eye gates every visual change.

## SESSION 2026-06-21 — Orchestration "brain on top" crown fix (LANDED)
- **The operator's complaint** ("brain is not on top and many more flaws") was root-caused live, not guessed: the orchestration FOCUS tab was too large (`scale 0.82`) and centered too high (`y −0.34`), so its top edge reached up into the brainstem — the brain looked *embedded* in the slab. A second flaw: a redundant curved umbilical was drawn from a vertebra arcing back into the focus tab (an errant "fat pipe" ending mid-air), even though the spine already plunges straight into it.
- **Fix (sacred palette/textures untouched — geometry/scale/position only):**
  - `livingWorkspaceLayout.ts` — lowered + shrank the points-orchestration focus pose (`y −0.34 → −0.62`, `scale 0.82 → 0.64`) so the brain + upper spine own the top of frame and the spine feeds DOWN into the focus.
  - `MaterializedTab.tsx` — the FOCUS is now fed by the spine directly (no umbilical); only WAITING tabs get a vertebra-rooted nerve. Errant pipe gone.
- **Verified LIVE on :5173 &being=points** at 3 and 4 tabs: brain crowns → spine descends → plunges into the focus hero (center) → waiting tabs nerve-tethered in the corners. 209/209 superbrain tests green; mirrored to gitignored `GAG demo/gag-orchestrator`.
- **Also committed (poster-palette chrome alignment, was uncommitted in the worktree):** `superbrain.css` neon-tetrad set to the poster's "STATUS FROM BODY" legend (`--neon-cyan #7bf5fb`, `--neon-purple #b06eff`, `--neon-green #54f0a0`, `--neon-orange #ff7e40`), deeper purple-black void; `index.css` aura, `shell.css` cosmos/voyage-dot, `GagosChrome.css` wordmark, `SuperbrainHUD.tsx` "ONE BODY · MANY POSTURES · THE INTERFACE IS ALIVE" footer — all conforming the DOM chrome to the poster bible.
- **Strategic decision (Unreal Engine question):** NO to Unreal — it's a native game engine, not a web library; the only web paths (Pixel Streaming / dead HTML5 export) cost a GPU per user, kill local-first, and mean a full rewrite. Stay browser-native; the real fidelity jump is **WebGPU + TSL + GPU compute particles** (already the `nextgen-3d-design-direction` plan). Offered to spike a flagged WebGPU point-field prototype for A/B — awaiting operator go.
- **NEXT (operator's eye):** his :5173 fidelity verdict on the crown; optional tuning I flagged — shrink waiting-corner scale (`0.42 → ~0.34`) to sharpen hierarchy, and nudge the bottom-left corner off the chat box at 4 tabs.

## Last Completed + Verified
- Operator continued after the Phase 3 lab proof; treated as approval to run the product sync gate.
- Coordination task `gag-phase3-product-sync` was routed to Codex and claimed as builder with dirty adoption.
- Dry-run manifest verified before writing: 55 live source files, 22 test/support files, 5 assets, 1 generated CSS; `organismLifecycle.ts`/test and the `MaterializationLayer` lifecycle hook were included.
- Ran `npm run port`: product `brain.glb` stripped in the product copy only; 83 files ported into `frontend/src/superbrain`.
- Product gates passed: `frontend` `npm test` -> 39 files / 237 tests passed; `frontend` `npm run build` -> passed.
- Product Vite route is live at `http://localhost:5173/?ui=superbrain`; sandboxed launch hit Windows `spawn EPERM`, elevated hidden launch succeeded and route returned HTTP 200.
- Patched `GAG demo/gag-orchestrator/tools/probe-phase3-lifecycle.mjs` so product proof types through the real hidden `BrainstemIntake` input when present while preserving the lab `window.__materializeInput` fallback. `node --check tools\probe-phase3-lifecycle.mjs` passed.
- Product browser proof passed: `node tools\probe-phase3-lifecycle.mjs "http://localhost:5173/?ui=superbrain"` -> one canvas, valid intake, approval hold, conducting, completion settle, reabsorbing, and error repair lifecycle states.
- Product proof artifacts were written under `C:/tmp`: `gag-phase3-lifecycle-intake.png`, `approval.png`, `conducting.png`, `settle.png`, `reabsorbing.png`, `error.png`, and `gag-phase3-lifecycle-probe.json`.
- Screenshot inspection: product states are nonblank and framed. Intake shows duplicate visible ownership because `BrainstemIntake` renders the real input surface while `MaterializationLayer` observes the same input tab; lifecycle proof is valid, but Phase 4 should collapse visible input ownership to one renderer path.
- Updated `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-18-living-being-frontend-100-roadmap.md` with the Phase 3 product-port checkpoint and next Phase 4 action.
- Appended `.aios/memory/experiences.jsonl` row `gag-phase3-product-sync`; JSONL parse of the new row passed with confidence `0.84`.
- Closeout hygiene passed: `git diff --check` over RESUME, experiences, roadmap, product superbrain, and the lab lifecycle probe returned exit 0 with only normal Windows CRLF warnings; `node --check tools\probe-phase3-lifecycle.mjs` passed.
- Coordination handoff was attempted once and succeeded before this final RESUME refresh; a final hash-pinned reviewer handoff should follow this file update so the tree snapshot includes current resume state.

## Single Next Action
**(2026-06-21 afternoon — CURRENT):** FRONT-DOOR RENOVATION LARGELY DONE + committed — 8 commits `cfe669a`→`6f52621`: single-GAGOS collapse · the being speaks first (greeting + 3 starters) · orchestrated chrome arrival + live state-pill pulse · living cyan conversation (voice bubble + streaming caret) · responsive · auto-focus · honest-states (polled offline pill + classified error + Retry) · keyboard a11y (skip-to-chat first-focusable + SR live narration) · persona Jarvis→GAGOS (anchor strengthened) · honest work-materialization (code tab ONLY for real code; alignment preamble stripped; conversation shown as chat). All product-safe (survive `npm run port`); `vite build` + 209/209 tests green throughout.

**NEXT = OPERATOR'S RTX (the being is his hero — can't be judged headlessly, FIDELITY law):**
1. **Glow elevation** — do it LIVE on `window.__POINTFIELD.uGlowMul` / `window.__POSTURE` dials (a blind headless attempt over-hazed + was reverted byte-clean; the being code is untouched). Investigation mapped the knobs: `pointFieldMaterial.ts` (core weight, posture energy-restore ×1.6), `constants.ts` `bloomPoints` (threshold-gate), exposure. Bake the operator's dialed values + capture goldens.
2. **Fresh-load condense** — root cause found: arrival fires `transitionToArriving(COALESCENCE | AWAKENING)` on mount (`WorkspaceCanvas.tsx`). LIKELY a degraded-test-browser artifact (clean loads condensed fine; ~17 reloads exhaust WebGL contexts) — confirm with ONE clean reload on the RTX; fix mapped if real.

**PENDING IN THE BROWSER:** an approval slab is HELD (`create training_ground/reverse_string.py`) — operator APPROVE/REJECT (never self-approved; the gate is the thesis).
**HONEST CAVEAT:** the local 3B model holds the GAGOS identity inconsistently (prompt forcefully strengthened; a larger local model = rock-solid).
**Untracked (prior audit session, operator's call):** `.github/` (CI) + `SYSTEM_AUDIT_2026-06-21.md`.

The Phase-4a posture work below is COMPLETE — historical context.

**Phase 4a COMPLETE** (commits 62cf1de→2453d86): the spectral-v1 posture-color system is wired into the whole 3D body — bodyPosture contract (62cf1de), brain hue (d0e9af5), nerve hue + flow speed (4c75bc8), vertebra surfaces (1f03dfd), brainstem intake (2453d86). The body shifts COLOR + signal-SPEED by the REAL lifecycle phase (rest violet → think magenta → stream cyan → hold amber → complete green → error red), blended OVER the sacred regional palette (tint ≤0.8; ==0 byte-identical canon; brainMaterial cache key v8→v9). All gates green (tsc · 254 tests · build); v9 shader compiles; software-GL verified (canon at rest, hue shifts across phases, zero runtime errors); lab-mirrored (BrainstemIntake is product-only). Damped posture lives in SCENE_UNIFORMS (uPosture/uPostureTint/uFlow); live phase flows MaterializationLayer → organismPhaseBus → scene-root useFrame.

**LIVE NOW (since Phase 4a):** (1) posture-strength DIAL — `window.__POSTURE` (commit 07220b3) lets the operator tune tint/flow live in his real browser (brainTint 0.55↔0.8, surfaceTint, flowScale) and report values to bake. (2) Phase-6 REPLY emanation amplified (commit 0c032fe): bigger glowing reply text + longer cortex speaking-glow. The reply DATA pipeline is confirmed healthy (POST /api/v1/chat streams text_chunk Hinglish via llama3.2:3b; sendVoiceTurn accumulates data.text).

**OPERATOR-EYE QUEUE (only his real GPU can settle these — software-GL is approximate):**
- TINT STRENGTH: slide `window.__POSTURE.brainTint`/`surfaceTint`/`flowScale` to taste, report numbers → I bake as defaults + capture canon goldens.
- REPLY PROMINENCE/PLACEMENT: reply sits upper-right (clear of the brain); if weak, next tune = descend-through-the-stem placement (`REPLY_TEXT_LOCAL` in BrainstemIntake).

**FULL-BODY POSTURE SWEEP DONE**: conductor overlay (3a24fca), cortical fireflies (3329f10), accretion core (5eafe43). EVERY visible region now reads the posture — brain, nerve (hue+flow), vertebra surfaces, brainstem intake, conductor overlay, cortical fireflies, accretion core — one body, many postures, all riding the shared POSTURE_DIAL. (AttentionConductionPulse's gold bead left as a deliberate POSTURE_GOLD accent.) The posture SYSTEM is complete; only the STRENGTH (operator's `window.__POSTURE` dial) + reply placement remain for his real-GPU eye.

**WORK-STREAMING DONE** (9a3dfc7): content code now materializes LINE BY LINE (~90ms/line + active-line cursor; reduced-motion shows whole) — the demoplan "Showing Work" phase. The being visibly writes its output into the vertebra surface.

**The demoplan 7-phase arc is now substantially realized**: arrival · rest · awakening/conversation (wake + reply) · materialization · orchestration (multi-tab) · working+showing-work (line-by-line stream) · reabsorption — with the full-body posture system (color/flow/speed by REAL state) overlaying all. Branch 97+ ahead of master.

NEXT (operator's pick): (a) **his `:5173` dial verdict** → bake the tint + capture canon goldens (the real unlock); (b) reply placement tune; (c) true per-chunk backend code streaming (currently a visual reveal of received code); (d) further polish. Self-verify each; gates green + commit per slice.

## Open Approvals / Blockers
- Phase 3 product sync is implementation-verified; reviewer approval is still pending.
- Visual follow-up for Phase 4: collapse duplicate product intake ownership into one visible renderer path while preserving the real hidden typing fallback.
- Worktree was already dirty before this slice; do not revert unrelated existing changes.
- Product Vite server is running hidden from `frontend` on port 5173 with logs in `.aios/audit/phase3-product-vite-*.log`.
