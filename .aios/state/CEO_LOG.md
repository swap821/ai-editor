# CEO_LOG — daily advisory to the AI-OS

> Claude Code, acting as CEO of this project, leaves one dated entry per working
> session: where we are · the single highest-leverage next move · one risk.
> **Honesty:** a prompt can't wake itself (see blueprint A1 / CLAUDE.md §0), so
> "daily" here means "every session I'm run." For a true daily cadence, wire an
> external scheduler — approvals stay ON, plan-only when unattended.

## 2026-06-03 — Advice #1

**Where we are.** The core is real, not aspirational: **116 tests green**, and the
security gate was just hardened (Slice 1a closed three live scope bypasses found in
review and is committed). You're past "does it work" — the question now is *make it
whole without breaking what works.*

**Highest-leverage next move.** Protect the green. Keep shipping in small, verified
slices exactly like 1a: one component → tests-first → full suite green → commit →
next. And keep the working tree clean — commit the real artifacts (`AUDIT.md`,
`PLAN.md`, the blueprint cleanup) and `.gitignore` the junk (`.coverage`, the stray
CSS) so `RESUME.md` is the only "where we are" and git is the only "what's done."

**Risk to watch.** The 100% goal vs. "first learn to breathe." 100% scope is the
destination, but the failure mode is opening voice + knowledge-graph + Docker fronts
before the core demo path is bulletproof. Hold slice discipline; resist breadth. If a
session can't end with the suite green, the last slice was too big — shrink the next.

**Scoreboard.** End every session with: full suite green + `RESUME.md` current.
Today: ✅ 116 green · ✅ RESUME current · ✅ 2 commits (blueprint v6, scope-lock fix).

## 2026-06-06 - CEO note (session: edit_file fix + GitHub remote)
- Shipped: fixed the edit_file path-doubling bug (read + edit now share project-relative addressing); suite 150/1 green; committed 68653dc on master.
- Infra: stood up a PRIVATE GitHub remote (swap821/ai-editor) + gh CLI, unblocking Claude-web cloud/ultracode - the right call given the RAM-bound local box. No secrets pushed (frontend/.env gitignored).
- Highest-leverage next: finish the live e2e of the fix on Bedrock (never exercised end-to-end), then return to the premium-UI thread (the thing that actually bugs you).
- Risk to watch: RollbackEngine snapshot target - training_ground shares the main .git; confirm pre-edit snapshots land where expected before trusting the rollback net.
