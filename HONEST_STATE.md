# Honest State of Sovereignty

**Last updated:** 2026-09-01 (verified on `9381121`)
**Proof script:** `prove_sovereignty.py` (18 assertions, 6 phases, all pass)

## What "sovereign" means here

"Sovereign" is a testable property, not a marketing claim. This system is
sovereign to the extent that it can operate meaningfully without external
LLM calls, using only its own verified experience.

## What works offline

| Capability | Organ | Evidence |
|------------|-------|----------|
| Replay of practiced **read/verify** tasks | S1 Cerebellum | Compiled playbooks execute through the security gateway without an LLM. **Write steps do not compile:** `_COMPILABLE_TOOLS` (`aios/core/cerebellum.py:41`) admits only `read_file`, `read_directory`, `execute_terminal`, `verify` — `create_file`/`edit_file` need content that step summaries do not store. |
| Multi-hop inference | S2 Knowledge Graph | Confidence-weighted graph traversal composes answers from verified facts |
| Planning of known task shapes | S3 Native Planner | Verified skills and swarm patterns produce deterministic plans |
| Verification | Verifier | pytest runs via subprocess -- no LLM needed |

## What does NOT work offline

| Capability | Why | Honest degradation |
|------------|-----|-------------------|
| Novel tasks | No compiled playbook or verified pattern matches | Honest refusal: "I can't handle it natively yet" |
| **Replay of write workflows** | `create_file`/`edit_file` steps cannot compile into a playbook at all | Falls through to the LLM path. This is the workflow class the system most often performs, so the reflex layer does not yet cover its main job. |
| Reflection on failure | LLM needed to extract structured lessons | Silently skipped (logged at INFO) |
| LLM-based planning | LLM needed for novel task decomposition | PlannerError with explanatory message |
| Chat (novel conversation) | LLM needed for general reasoning | Honest refusal before LLM loop |

## What "verified" means

A skill is verified after 3+ STRONG successes at >= 80% success rate.
A swarm pattern is verified after 2+ successes at >= 60% rate.
A fact is committed only after contradiction detection.
Verification strength follows the taxonomy in `aios/core/verification_strength.py`.

## What sovereignty is NOT

- It is NOT a foundation model. The system does not generate text, reason about
  novel concepts, or produce creative output without an LLM.
- It is NOT autonomous. Every YELLOW action stops for an approval, and the
  cerebellum replays through the same gate as LLM-proposed actions.

  **Measured correction, 2026-09-06.** This bullet used to read "the operator
  has final authority on all YELLOW actions". Organ 55's mission M7 measures
  that claim and it FAILS: the approval token is returned to the principal that
  requested the action, so one principal can request and approve the same
  action with no human anywhere in the loop. The gate is real -- nothing runs
  without an approval -- but the system cannot presently prove the approval came
  from the operator rather than from the requester. The audit rows are
  identical. "Final authority" was a stronger claim than the evidence supports,
  and this document is the wrong place to make one.
- It is NOT omniscient. The knowledge graph contains only verified facts. Its
  horizon is visible and honest.
- It is NOT permanent. A compiled playbook decompiles after 2 consecutive
  failures. A demoted skill invalidates its playbook. Sovereignty is earned
  and can be lost.

## Decided, not yet built

**The learning loop, Option A** (operator decision, 2026-09-06). Stage 1 is a
content-identical, idempotent `create_file`: replay checks the target digest and
abstains if it differs. The blocker is `_COMPILABLE_TOOLS` in
`aios/core/cerebellum.py`, which excludes writes, so a compiled playbook can
today replay only reads and commands.

Recorded here rather than built because it is roughly a three-week effort. The
alternative considered and rejected was Option B: narrow the public claim to
match what the loop actually does. The claim stays; the work is owed.

## How to prove it

```
python prove_sovereignty.py
```

18 assertions. Zero spin. If any fails, the word "sovereign" is revoked
until the underlying defect is fixed.

## The One Law

> A task the system has verifiably completed three times before executes
> entirely without an LLM call, through the full security gateway, with
> human approval on YELLOW steps, verified by the same evidence-based
> verifier that judged the original successes.

**Where the One Law holds today, and where it does not.** It holds for tasks
built from read, directory-read, terminal and verify steps. It does **not**
hold for any task that writes a file, because such a step cannot be compiled
into a playbook in the first place (`aios/core/cerebellum.py:41`). The Law is
therefore satisfied for a class the system rarely runs and unsatisfied for the
class it usually runs. Stated here rather than left to be discovered, because
the gap is the difference between the claim and the product.
